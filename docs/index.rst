Maintenance
^^^^^^^^^^^

These are notes on maintaining the various open-source projects I distribute - while mostly as a way of making various tasks easier for me, these notes will hopefully be useful to other people and projects.

Pages on specific languages or topics contain detailed information and explanations. Checklist pages provide minimal notes on steps to take in a project or package's workflow.

The status page links to most of the open-source projects I have published and displays their current status. This includes number of open issues, build status and package information.
