Status
^^^^^^

This page links to most of the open-source projects I have published and displays their current status. It should list all projects from `my github profile <borntyping_>`_, though projects from `borntyping-sandbox`_ are not listed.

Python packages
===============

These packages are actively maintained, though several are feature complete and have no plans for futher improvements. You can view `a list of all packages owned or maintained by me on PyPI <https://warehouse.python.org/user/borntyping/>`_.

    :repo: borntyping/python-colorlog

Rust packages
=============

Rust packages are currently only used for my final year university project, and are not really supported or ready yet.

.. project:: cyborg
.. project:: cyborg-demo
.. project:: mutiny
.. project:: psutil
    :repo: borntyping/rust-psutil
.. project-status:: rust

Personal projects
=================

These projects are published under open-source licences, but are primarily for my own use.

.. project:: maintenance
.. project:: deployment
.. project:: borntyping.github.io
.. project-status::

Deprecated projects
===================

These projects are very old, but I can't bring myself to get rid of them. Most of the code is awful. *They are not supported or maintained.*

.. project:: chef-ladder
.. project:: this-is-a-game
.. project:: nus
.. project:: django-kaos
.. project:: django-kaos-avatar
.. project:: enginesheddata
.. project-status:: deprecated

Deprecated python packages
--------------------------

Bugfixes are published for these Python packages, but no further work is planned. ``diceroll`` and ``spotter`` have been replaced by ``dice`` and ``watch-fs`` respectively, while ``argumented`` and ``infix`` shouldn't be used.

.. project:: argumented
    :repo: borntyping/python-argumented
.. project:: diceroll
.. project:: infix
    :repo: borntyping/python-infix
.. project:: spotter
.. project-status:: python
